# React & Redux capstone project - Covid-19 World Report

In this project, I did work with the real live data API. My task was to build a web application  that provides statistical informations. 
The application will allow users to check daily reports about Covid-19 all around the world. The users can get many information by Continents -> Countries and specific Country.
